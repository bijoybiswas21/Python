# Installation tools


Below are some tools you can download before getting started with Python. It's all about personal preference, so feel free to choose the ones that work best for you!


| Name of the tools | 
| ------------- |
|[Python download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)|
|[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)|
|[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)|
|[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)|

I use Google Colab for Python programming, and it's one of the best interactive tools out there. I love it because it allows me to add more documentation to my code and create quality tutorials, making it easier to share knowledge and improve learning.
