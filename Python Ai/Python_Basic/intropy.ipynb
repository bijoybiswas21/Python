    "\n",
    "## 2. Variables and Data Types\n",
    "- Variables store data values.\n",
    "- Common data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Operators\n",
    "- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`\n",
    "- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Control Flow\n",
    "- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
    "- Loops: `for`, `while`\n",
    "- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Functions\n",
    "- Defined using `def` keyword.\n",
    "- Can take arguments and return values.\n",
    "- Example:\n",

    "    def add(a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Data Structures\n",
    "- **List:** Ordered, mutable collection. `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "- **Tuple:** Ordered, immutable collection. `(1, 2, 3)`\n",
    "- **Dictionary:** Key-value pairs. `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`\n",

    "\n",
    "## 7. String Manipulation\n",
    "- Strings are sequences of characters.\n",
    "- Common methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Input and Output\n",
    "- Input: `input()`\n",
    "- Output: `print()`\n",
    "\n",

    "- Always close files: `.close()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Exception Handling\n",
    "- Handle errors using `try`, `except`, `finally`\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # handle error\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Modules and Packages\n",
    "- Import modules using `import` keyword.\n",
    "- Use built-in and third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "- Concepts: Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation\n",
    "- Define a class:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. List Comprehensions\n",
    "- Concise way to create lists:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Lambda Functions\n",
    "- Anonymous functions:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Useful Standard Libraries\n",
    "- `math`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`, `random`, `json`\n",
